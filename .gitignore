# This file contains names (and wildcards) of files that
# Git should ignore.

# Since we only care about the actual source code files,
# all the libraries are ignored, as are the files that 
# are created when you compile.

# LIBRARIES

# These two lines are a bit tricky.
# The ! syntax negates a pattern,
# but it needs a pattern, not just a directory.
# So turn the first line into a pattern for ! to negate.
