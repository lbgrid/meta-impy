 ABOUT META7

   Meta 7 is a Virtual World loosely based on OpenSimulator core
   server code.

   The meta 7 Viewer is our open source client application designed
   for the world, based on both Imprudence (an open source metaverse
   viewer project) and the Second Life viewer.

   Meta 7 is online at http://www.meta7.com/


   The latest source code for the meta-impy viewer is always
   available at:

 ABOUT META-IMPY

    The old meta 7 viewer was based on an ancient version of Emerald.  We
    need an update.  After much discussion and evaluation, and too much
    delay, I decided to fork and modify the Imprudence 1.4.0 code base
    to our requirements.  Thus the meta-impy viewer was born.  This time
    around I will try to keep up with the upstream changes.

    I agree with the Imprudence manifesto.  I also have my own ideas
    about how code should be written, and how the mess that is the LL
    code base should be morphed into something sane.  I don't think that
    moving to the SL 2 code base is such a good idea.  Even now I still
    see problems from the move to the SL 1.23 code base.  I thought
    moving from 1.22 was a bad idea to.  LL has us playing catch up at
    their chosen pace.  We should just fix up their horrid code and
    streak ahead of them.

    Since this is being done for meta7, and meta7 does not care about LL
    TPVP, somethings are just going to be changed specifically to suit
    the meta7 grid.  On the other hand, there are some things we might
    implement that are of general usefulness, or already on the Impy
    wish list.  I will try to write them such that Impy developers can
    cherry pick those things, then let the Impy developers know.

    Note, since we don't care about LL TPVP, it's likely that meta7
    viewers will not be TPVP compliant.  Meta 7 viewers are made for use
    on the meta7 grid.  They will probably work on the SL grid, but that
    is not important to us, and not recommended by us.  Use at your own
    risk on the SL grid.
